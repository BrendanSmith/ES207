**Objective Statement:**

```{r,echo=false}
# Load libraries
source("getCDEC_fixed.R")
source("getdailyUSGS.R")
```

**Methods:** We begin by exploratory data analysis of the time series data of discharge at the Michigan Bar USGS gaging station along the Cosumnes river. 

**Data:**
**Code:**

##Step 1 - Data Retrieval and Troubleshooting##

```{r}
# grab CSV data from USGS Website
# The getCDEC_fixed.R file was modified to return the filename upon
# completion for easier data manipulation
filename <- get.CDEC("MHB","D","41","2011/10/01","2012/09/30")
Y # Enter Y at prompt to write csv file
```

```{r}
# Call function created to pull USGS data. This also saves to workspace under "usgs.dat"
get.dailyUSGS("11335000","00060","2011-10-01","2012-09-30")
```

##Step 2 - Formatting and EDA##


##Step 3 - Time Series using Cosumnes River discharge##
